Features:
- Mirror overworld portals can be made just like a Nether portal, but packed mud replaces the obsidian, and water replaces the fire, making disabled mirror overworld portal blocks all over the frame. Throwing a fire charge into the portal will cause the mirror overworld portal to be enabled.
- If in the mirror overworld for too long, axolotls, armadillos, bats, camels, cats, cows, donkeys, frogs, horses, mooshrooms, mules, ocelots, turtles, parrots, pigs, rabbits, sheep, striders, tadpoles, villagers, wandering traders, cods, salmons, tropical fish, pufferfish, dolphins, foxes, goats, llamas, pandas, piglins immune to zombification, polar bears, piglin brutes immune to zombification, hoglins immune to zombification, trader llamas, wolves, evokers, pillagers, ravagers, vindicators, and witches will end up dying because they're incompatible and will quickly die from diseases, predations, or incompatible conditions. These mobs will also run away from mirror overworld portals. If they somehow find their way to the mirror overworld, they will go straight to the portal to get back to the classic overworld. If they're too far from the portal, these mobs will also tremble, indicating to the player that the mirror overworld is bad for them. Wolves, foxes, and axolotls get weaker if they're in the mirror overworld, incompatible mounts won't cooperate, villagers and wandering traders won't trade, and piglins won't barter.
- Trees from the classic overworld won't grow in the mirror overworld either. Same for azaleas, bamboo, beetroots, carrots, potatoes, wheat, bushes, sweet berry bushes, firefly bushes, pink petals, wildflowers, sunflowers, rose bushes, peonies, lilacs, cacti, cocoa beans, melons, pumpkins, and sugar canes.
- Players will also die if in the mirror overworld for too long, unless their chestplate is enchanted with Prehistoric Resilience. Prehistoric Resilience can be occasionally bartered from piglins.
- Dinosaur eggs can be found in warm ancient ruins.
- These vanilla mobs can still spawn in the mirror overworld: sniffer, bee, nautilus, and zombie nautilus. Zombie nautilus jockeys from the mirror overworld are ridden by zombie dinosaurs instead of the drowneds from the classic overworld.
- Instead of zombies, skeletons, creepers, spiders, husks, strays, boggeds, parcheds, drowneds, and endermen populating the mirror overworld at night, clawborns, bonekins, saurfolks, dinosuls, theraks, velokhans, zombie and skeleton dinosaurs, zombie crestfolk, paleo-creepers, and paleo-endermen populate the mirror overworld at night. Unlike most undead mobs in the classic overworld, undead mobs native to the mirror overworld won't burn during the day, giving more room to cure zombie crestfolks but making undead mobs still loaded to attack well during the day.
- Troodons might pick up objects dropped on the ground, especially shiny, unusual items, or both.
- Crestfolks are practically the villagers of the mirror overworld. However, unlike villages and villagers, crestfolks populating the saurian villages aren't defenseless. These villages can only be entered through a bridge that closes at night, since stone walls and lava moats surround them. Trying to enter a saurian village at night is not a good idea since guards will attack anything on sight near the bridge. The guards also deal a lot of damage since they have to deal with almost everything. Guard crestfolks have both ranged and melee weapons; not even a wither or a warden is safe from the guards. The only mobs a guard won't attack at night are other crestfolks, saurian golems, and zombie crestfolks. For zombie crestfolks, guards will usually capture them and send them to the infirmary when the sun rises.
- Amber is the main resource used in saurian villages. Because just like villagers use emeralds as currency, crestfolks use amber as currency. Amber can be dropped from paleo-creepers or Raptor Raiders, gifted from chompers, traded from crestfolks, or extracted from Araucarioxylon trees. Chompers can also equip chomper armor, which is, of course, made of amber.
- Placing an amber block, a bone block, a cycad, and Araucarioxylon planks in a square shape with a pumpkin on top will summon a saurian golem, the saurian version of the iron golem, even more powerful, especially during wartime.
- Thinking of mistreating crestfolks as you do with villagers, I have bad news: crestfolks aren't easily subdoable. Attack one crestfolk, and the entire village will attack you and kill you in seconds. Thinking of kidnapping crestfolks with boats or minecarts, guess what, guards will also attack them. The only way to get a crestfolk to your base is if you cure a zombie crestfolk, and even a cured crestfolk doesn't mess around. Hit it, and you get one shot. They can also break blocks if they feel trapped, but a house should be enough for a cured crestfolk. You can also have a cured crestfolk to be your bodyguard if you treat them correctly.
- Crestfolks and Raptor Raiders are at war; however, crestfolks will usually win since the guards are already super lethal. The only way Raptor Raiders stand a chance against saurian villages is if they appear in a giant siege, and even then, crestfolks usually win.
- To cure a zombie crestfolk, it's the same as with zombie villages, but instead of using a golden apple, an amber apple or an amber glowbulb is used.
- Amber horns are used to deter dinosaurs from whoever used the amber horn. Crestfolks usually use them to deter dinosaurs from trampling on saurian villages.
- The only vanilla biomes present in the mirror overworld are plains, snowy plains, ice spikes, beaches, snowy beaches, stony shores, badlands, eroded badlands, swamps, deserts, all oceans, jagged peaks, frozen peaks, snowy slopes, windswept hills, windswept gravelly hills, rivers, frozen rivers, lush caves, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, not unchanged though. Any other biome will be replaced with a mirror biome.
- In the deep dark of the mirror overworld, sculk shriekers will summon paleo-wardens instead of wardens.
- Paleo-pale gardens are vast plains instead of woodlands like in the classic overworld. Paleo-creaking hearts blend into the ground instead of a pale oak tree.
- Insomnia in the mirror overworld will spawn paleo-phantoms instead of phantoms.
- Paleo-allays are found within Raptor Raiders outposts and mansions. They can be duplicated with amber instead of amethyst.
- Paleo-shulkers are found in Mesozoic marshes and Cretaceous dunes. They act just like their modern counterparts, but spawn within biomes rather than being generated in a structure. They still spawn rarely, or else, if you ever faced like ten shulkers at once, it can be chaos very fast.
- Placing skeleton dinosaur skulls instead of wither skeleton skulls on the T-shaped structure of soul sand or soul soil to summon the wither will summon the paleo-wither instead.
- Pitcher plants can be duplicated with bone meal in the mirror overworld.
- Cycads are the only tree with a wood type native to both the classic overworld and the mirror overworld. In the classic overworld, cycads are found within jungles and savannas. Ginkgo trees are also native to both overworlds. Ginkgo trees are found rarely in plains and villages.
- Sniffers now dig up more ancient plants.
- Since wolves and cats can't be brought to the mirror overworld, players can tame the chomper instead. Scares both skeleton dinosaurs, paleo-creepers, and paleo-phantoms, and attacks whatever its owner hits. Won't attack crestfolks, saurian golems, ghasts, or zombie crestfolks. They instantly one-shot creepers and paleo-creepers. You tame the chomper by feeding it native flowers from the mirror overworld or any type of meat. Chompers can also be ridden since most mounts can't be brought to the mirror overworld either. Sleeping next to a chomper can give the player gifts like cats. Since donkeys and llamas are unavailable in the mirror overworld, chompers can also be equipped with a chest.
- Ginkgo extract can give the player haste and night vision within the correct dose, like one per every in-game day, but exceeding that dose can cause nausea, blindness, weakness, and wither while removing the haste and night vision from before.
- At night, stampedes can randomly happen, but they're rare. Stampedes are made of stegosaurs, triceratops, iguanodons, parasaurolophuses, corythosaurs, lambeosaurs, edmontosauruses, pachycephalosaurs, kentrosaurs, dryosaurs, torosaurus, spitters, and tramplers.
- If brought to the classic overworld, chompers don't become useless, but they still lose the supercharge they get in the mirror overworld. They lose their ability to dash like camels, are much slower, and don't gift amber to their sleeping owners.
- Since sheep are unavailable and paleo-phantoms respond to insomnia as well, if the player doesn't have a bed from the overworld, another option is to make a Mesozoic bed from bristlebacks instead of wool.
- Amber can also be a rare drop from creepers.
- Spitters are pacific mobs that only attack when threatened. They also spit at Raptor Raiders.
- Pluckers will harvest crops and store plucker cud after harvest. Plucker cud can be smelted into amber or used as a brewing ingredient to get the dino-might effect. Anything with dino-might will have nearby wild dinosaurs to defend them from hostile mobs.
- Tramplers are pacific mobs that can still deal damage if anything is too close to them. When provoked, tramplers can charge at whatever has attacked them, notably Raptor Raiders. They're also part of stampedes.
- Watchers will leave markers at any point of interest, like structures. Watchers also display warning signs when a stampede is incoming.
- Fellers cut down trees and store what is collected in a pouch that the player can interact with to get them.
- Since crestfolks don't use classic brewing stands because nether portals don't work in the mirror overworld, they use mirror brewing stands instead, same as classic brewing stand, but an amber rod replaces the blaze rod. Glowbulb juice replaces blaze powder, bitterpod powder replaces nether warts, sunpod extract replaces redstone, sunspire replaces gunpowder, and resinroot dust replaces dragon's breath.
- Resinroot dust can be used to brew resin skin potions. Resin skin reduces damage to the player while canceling all fall damage, a low-cost resistance potion that comes with fall damage immunity. Dripstone also can't deal damage to anything with the resin skin effect.
- Glowbulbs can be used to brew herdcall potions. Herdcall attracts sauropods to whatever has the herdcall effect.
- Sunspire powder can be used to brew sunpulse potions. Sunpulse increases the speed and strength of whatever has the sunpulse effect, but it only works during the day.
- Bones can be used to brew dino-heart potions. Dino-heart turns whatever has the dino-heart effect into a walking bone meal. Just be careful not to walk near saplings with this effect.
- Bitterpod powder can be used to brew herdcalm potions. Herdcalm will turn off stampedes to a 50 block radius of whoever has the herdcalm effect.
- Amber can be used to brew prehistoric comfort. Prehistoric comfort gives more breathing room to any incompatible mobs to leave the mirror overworld. Imagine water breathing, but instead of using it underwater, it's used for any incompatible mobs to be safe in the mirror overworld until the effect wears off. Splash potions of prehistoric comfort can also be bartered by piglins.
- Moonpulps can be used to brew moonpulse potions. Moonpulse increases haste and saturation while also giving night vision to whatever has the moonpulse effect, but only works at night.
- Saurfolks can summon paleo-vexes to fight with the rest of the Raptor Raiders.
- Renaming a stegosaurus "Stogg" will change its texture to match the character from My Singing Monsters.
- Renaming a T. rex "Rex", "T-Rox", "Chopper", or "Dino-Rang" will change its texture to match either character.
- Renaming an ankylosaurus "Bash" or "Slobber Tooth" will cause its texture to match either Skylander.
- Renaming a Triceratops "Tri-Tip" will cause its texture to match the Earth Sensei from Skylanders Imaginators.
- Renaming a brontosaurus "Arlo" will change its texture to match the character from The Good Dinosaur.
- Renaming a brachiosaurus "Braloha" will change its texture to match the grass/ground pal from Palworld.
- Deinonychus can often kick tramplers towards the player. When the player or a tamed mob has the dino-might effect, deinonychus kicks away hostile mobs from the player. Deinonychus can give a small boost by kicking the player forward.
- Ankylosaurus can greatly push tramplers towards the player while also giving the player significant knockback. When the player or a tamed mob has the dino-might effect, ankylosaurus scoops away hostile mobs.
- T. rexes can cause tramplers to sprint. When the player or a tamed mob has the dino-might effect, t. rexes eat nearby hostile mobs.
- Stegosaurus can cause tramplers to be launched at any nearby random point. With the dino-might effect, stegosaurus can one shot hostile mobs.
- The rest of the dinosaurs simply attack the attacker when the entity with the dino-might effect is attacked.
- Players or tamed mobs can create stampedes of their own with the herdcall effect. Sauropods affected by herdcall become unstoppable bulldozers until the effect wears off. Mobs and structures in the way of these sauropods get trampled and get destroyed instantly.
- Not only that, but stampedes can also be triggered by rumble drums. Rumble drums also work in the classic overworld, except the classic overworld stampedes are made of cows, pigs, sheep, horses, donkeys, llamas, camels, and goats.
